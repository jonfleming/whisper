[60.00s -> 67.00s]  All right, guys, as we come together tonight and we're kind of prepping for camp, I just
[67.00s -> 71.00s]  wanted to kind of share something that was on the court today.
[71.00s -> 76.00s]  You know, we see in Isaiah chapter 6, God is going to send out a messenger that he needs
[76.00s -> 79.00s]  them to preach the good news to Judah.
[79.00s -> 88.00s]  And God asks, who is going to go for us?
[88.00s -> 90.00s]  And then we see Isaiah's response.
[90.00s -> 96.00s]  It's a pretty famous response, but he stands up and he tells God, here am I, send me.
[96.00s -> 102.00s]  And in just about a week, we're going to be at camp with about 500 students who all need
[102.00s -> 106.00s]  to hear the good news about what Jesus has done for them.
[106.00s -> 111.00s]  And I'm so proud to be a part of this group because each and every one of you has stood
[111.00s -> 114.00s]  up and says, here am I, send me.
[114.00s -> 115.00s]  We will go.
[115.00s -> 118.00s]  We will tell these kids about the good news of Jesus.
[118.00s -> 124.00s]  So tonight, we're going to talk a lot about logistics of camp and rules and everything
[124.00s -> 125.00s]  that you need to know.
[125.00s -> 129.00s]  But we are going to start out and we are going to worship Jesus and we're going to thank
[129.00s -> 132.00s]  him in advance for the good things that we know he's going to do.
[132.00s -> 133.00s]  Amen?
[133.00s -> 134.00s]  Amen.
[134.00s -> 137.00s]  So will you stand up and will you join me as we worship Jesus together?
