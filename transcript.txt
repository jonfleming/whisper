All right, guys, as we come together tonight and we're kind of prepping for camp, I just wanted to kind of share something that was on the court today. You know, we see in Isaiah chapter 6, God is going to send out a messenger that he needs them to preach the good news to Judah. And God asks, who is going to go for us? And then we see Isaiah's response. It's a pretty famous response, but he stands up and he tells God, here am I, send me. And in just about a week, we're going to be at camp with about 500 students who all need to hear the good news about what Jesus has done for them. And I'm so proud to be a part of this group because each and every one of you has stood up and says, here am I, send me. We will go. We will tell these kids about the good news of Jesus. So tonight, we're going to talk a lot about logistics of camp and rules and everything that you need to know. But we are going to start out and we are going to worship Jesus and we're going to thank him in advance for the good things that we know he's going to do. Amen? Amen. So will you stand up and will you join me as we worship Jesus together?
