[0.00s - 0.84s]  teresa
[0.00s - 1.20s]  part of the automotive industry in the future
[0.00s - 3.38s]  if trump were not to do this, the most likely scenario is that companies like byd
[0.14s - 1.84s]  would get around
[0.00s - 3.20s]  depends really on understanding the development of
[0.00s - 3.44s]  and being able to use the complicated set of
[0.00s - 5.24s]  one of the most just the largest automotive manufacturers in the world
[0.00s - 3.60s]  and it would kill almost all of the competition because china was using their entire economy
[0.00s - 1.86s]  say, this is the one area,
[2.00s - 3.18s]  one of the areas we're just going to win in
[0.56s - 3.86s]  because like byd doesn't just have the benefit of their own
[0.11s - 3.67s]  they've got great workers, they've got great strategists, they're making incredible products
[0.02s - 3.34s]  they deserve to, you know, be praised for all those things
[0.00s - 5.30s]  also have the support of the ccp in a strategic area and when things go wrong
[0.00s - 2.18s]  they have that at their back that can help them
[2.54s - 3.90s]  and that's the part that just needs to change
[0.00s - 3.96s]  so that's where we've been, that's why this issue is such a huge problem
[0.00s - 3.60s]  and i'm just impressed that we are actually taking measures right now
[0.14s - 3.52s]  look like they might actually be able to, because this is not
[0.00s - 1.36s]  just a us and china problem,
[1.68s - 3.68s]  every other country in the world also feels
[0.00s - 3.84s]  reveals the impacts of the way that china has been engaging in these unfair practices
[0.00s - 3.68s]  and like germany is another great example, the german economy
[0.00s - 3.00s]  is highly tied to automotive, and now bmw and volkswagen
[0.00s - 3.52s]  and all these other porsche companies that
[0.00s - 2.56s]  our crown jewels of the german economy
[2.56s - 3.68s]  are being eviscerated because
[0.00s - 2.96s]  they can become dependent on the chinese market that had become one of their most profitable
[2.96s - 3.24s]  markets
[0.00s - 2.40s]  they were silly and they engaged
[2.40s - 3.72s]  in this exchange of the idea
[0.00s - 5.76s]  expertise and experience and now they are having to face competition
[0.00s - 3.74s]  from chinese companies that is very very difficult for them
[0.00s - 5.60s]  to be able to withstand and that has the potential to tip the entire time
[0.00s - 3.00s]  germany into a very, very, very bad place very quickly
[0.00s - 3.56s]  you know, us and china problem this is a global problem and i think that fact
[0.00s - 3.76s]  also is one of the things that makes it much more likely that we are going to get to a
[0.00s - 3.02s]  that we are going to contain china economically
[0.00s - 3.44s]  three and that china is going to be contained that we're not going to like
[0.00s - 3.82s]  this is the ideal scenario if you were to paint
[0.00s - 3.58s]  a picture of world war ii where instead of appeasing nazi germany
[0.00s - 3.50s]  when they invaded austria that the whole world got together
[0.00s - 14.88s]  you know what this is it no more we're just gonna be done right here you can have austria
[0.00s - 3.08s]  further that is the type of situation that we're in today with china
[0.00s - 3.60s]  world looks different because we're in a post-nuclear age and so the weapons of this warfare
[0.00s - 3.68s]  are primarily economic, but that's the label i insist on
[0.00s - 1.50s]  thank you so much for joining us last minute
[0.00s - 2.00s]  i can't wait to hear what you have to say, so i'm just going to give you the mic
[2.00s - 4.00s]  wait, what's with your head?
[0.00s - 1.26s]  we've been talking about this the last couple of days,
[1.32s - 3.88s]  but the tariff rates were so competitive that they couldn't
[0.00s - 3.70s]  they couldn't stay it was just almost a freezing, for the most part
[0.00s - 3.04s]  so that i mean part of this is playing out in terms of our game
[0.00s - 3.38s]  together kind of play everything towards china i got everybody saying the same thing do i kind of
[0.00s - 3.52s]  would want to look at it is, one is, we have 125% tariff
[0.00s - 3.60s]  on china and we import a lot of china goods so that problem is still on
[0.02s - 3.78s]  so, supply issues from multiple countries still, you know,
[0.00s - 3.04s]  still have to be worked out but maybe short-term maybe contained i want to talk about this 10
[0.00s - 3.76s]  when i talk about clients actually is actually putting this administration plant-based case of
[0.00s - 1.74s]  what would this look like a couple months from now,
[1.80s - 2.58s]  however long you think this takes,
[2.86s - 3.66s]  and a lot of the conversations
[0.00s - 3.00s]  okay, how would your business run with a 10% tariff on the country?
[0.00s - 3.66s]  think that's where we're at i don't think that they're going away i don't think that that's how
[0.00s - 3.90s]  i think the announcement of the external revenue service is more permanent
[0.00s - 3.26s]  than, i don't know, this president and his administration are
[0.00s - 3.52s]  unpredictable but for me that's still that is those are fair
[0.00s - 3.56s]  you high tariff rates on every country coming into your business and you know what? with
[0.00s - 3.44s]  i think there's a path to adjust to that, but it does immediately blow up
[0.00s - 3.36s]  i would say a lot of business cases on a lot of like medium and small size companies and products
[0.00s - 2.84s]  because, i mean, a 10% increase is significant
[2.98s - 3.72s]  i mean, just getting it, it's all
[0.00s - 3.84s]  at once it's not like it's something that feathers in throughout the year so but if he does
[0.00s - 3.72s]  some room for adjustment i think the 10% is what people should be planning on
[0.00s - 4.00s]  but that's just a tariff that's just a duty there's all the other non-tariff barriers
[0.00s - 3.20s]  and then there's all these opportunities maybe for now for us to do this in other countries
[0.00s - 3.76s]  kind of walk away from this is we still have 125% of china i think that's going to lead
[0.00s - 3.24s]  a lot of supply issues i think we're going to have supply issues due to business case problems
[0.00s - 4.00s]  basically do a massive business cases turned upside down between countries
[0.00s - 3.00s]  and us manufacturers making product
[0.30s - 3.60s]  and that is still the case, but now to a smaller extent, but you're trying to go into one
[0.00s - 3.72s]  25 it's just a question of it's getting so absurdly high that you're basically not trading
[0.00s - 3.68s]  at that point and so my optimistic side says the higher that number
[0.00s - 3.18s]  goes maybe the closer we actually are to a deal with that but i think it's going to take some
[3.18s - 3.60s]  period of time
[0.00s - 2.58s]  because the issues with china are so complex
[0.00s - 3.60s]  i know there's a lot of champagne course copy right now, but i can put myself
[0.00s - 2.60s]  i think there's, if i were to play this out over the next 30 days, like if this doesn't wrap up
[0.00s - 2.00s]  and we don't get down to something closer to 10-
[1.07s - 3.07s]  teresa
[1.39s - 3.17s]  it's going to be a big impact for companies
[0.00s - 3.44s]  so the next round of things you're going to see are companies that can't produce products
[0.00s - 3.20s]  and lay people off, then you're going to see supply shocks for the companies that do decide to stay in business
[0.00s - 3.44s]  and that's what you're gonna start seeing in the news and then you may start seeing concerns over
[0.00s - 3.14s]  session and unemployment going up so there's going to be a lot of competing narratives
[0.00s - 3.48s]  to me, this isolating china is where i thought it would go and i'm glad it would go
[0.02s - 2.18s]  but i am still very concerned about the supply situation
[2.76s - 3.48s]  jeff, so just real quick
[0.00s - 3.40s]  can you comment on, like, if both things happen, if we are getting close?
[0.00s - 3.50s]  aluminum alloy swivel computer stand is a powerful
[0.00s - 3.40s]  and practical computer accessories that provides users
[0.00s - 3.04s]  like if there's basically certainty in the market regarding the fact that there are going to be
[0.00s - 2.90s]  that the deals are going to be mostly fair
[2.90s - 3.74s]  and then there's the
[0.18s - 3.60s]  also perfectly valid recognition that yeah it's going to be really
[0.00s - 3.42s]  choppy short-term economically for a whole bunch of nations and a whole bunch of
[0.00s - 3.46s]  businesses, like how do you think the market responds to certainty around
[0.00s - 2.08s]  where the tariff war is going and where it's going to end
[2.08s - 3.50s]  and what that means right now
[0.00s - 2.78s]  right now for a lot of people that are in acute pain
[1.14s - 3.16s]  you mean, like, it took the 10%?
[0.00s - 3.32s]  terror to stay on for the companies that don't have super resilient
[0.00s - 3.28s]  higher gross margin businesses that are making hardware they're making products you know that's
[0.00s - 3.44s]  that's going to cause some problems my advice to these companies is get in the room, don't
[0.00s - 2.56s]  all the parts on the table, apollo 13 style, let's go
[2.86s - 3.50s]  you're not going to get 10%
[0.00s - 3.64s]  maybe in one swoop but you could get a couple you could be like there's something
[0.00s - 3.36s]  about, and i teach this in terms of design for value, there's something about a target
[0.00s - 2.56s]  and a date, and it's, and you get people rallying around,
[2.66s - 3.30s]  like, you know, it's a poverty
[0.00s - 1.26s]  we have to get these, we have to get them home
[1.68s - 2.82s]  like, we just don't have time to figure this out
[2.96s - 3.56s]  same thing with the situation
[0.00s - 3.12s]  the best defense for these companies is to go look at their internet economics
[0.00s - 1.60s]  he's like, well, if they could do this, they would have done it yesterday
[1.78s - 3.46s]  well, there's a different bit of urgency right now because the whole world order
[0.00s - 3.28s]  has basically changed and you have to put the administration on hand over time
[0.00s - 3.20s]  is some sort of residual terror i don't think the external revenue service is going away
[0.00s - 2.96s]  to say i'm taking in billions and billions of dollars so people continue to say that
[0.00s - 3.44s]  by the way, it's still not party time when we have a basic
[0.00s - 3.36s]  a supply like it's almost it's almost an import ban on china 125 percent
[0.00s - 3.12s]  who's gonna you know import and keep selling and like you guys see these ridiculous things of like
[0.00s - 3.32s]  trump liberation day and putting it, i mean, i know it's cute and it looks fine, but to me as a consumer,
[0.00s - 2.40s]  of a joke i don't want to see that i want you to just go solve the problem with your
[2.40s - 3.30s]  report i want you to take your costs down
[0.00s - 3.16s]  let you just blame blame the administration which by the way i'm not happy with how this is all
[3.16s - 3.72s]  managed but
[0.00s - 2.34s]  you know, so i think for consumers, i think it's going to be a mixed bag
[2.52s - 3.74s]  it's certainly better than where we were 12 hours ago
[0.00s - 2.76s]  i definitely think you'll bring on that china piece already later
[2.76s - 3.56s]  real quick, let me talk to your head
[0.14s - 3.66s]  yeah hi how are you hi guys yeah when you make a bad mistake
[0.69s - 2.93s]  to try and cover it up as best you can and do a little bit of tap dancing
[0.00s - 1.20s]  some tuck dancing right now
[2.02s - 3.44s]  i mean, this was a very good
[0.00s - 2.90s]  execute a strategy i don't know if the strategy was right or wrong
[0.08s - 3.46s]  whatever it was, it was separately executed as to blow back against
[0.00s - 2.48s]  and the administration, and they're doing the best they can
[2.60s - 3.32s]  they took a rumor from yesterday
[0.00s - 5.66s]  morning and turned it into a strategy for today you know 90-day wait
[0.00s - 2.28s]  and all 75 people have come to us and blah, blah, blah
[2.80s - 3.36s]  so, you know
[0.82s - 3.62s]  every administration as a mistake this was a facing
[0.00s - 3.40s]  i'm very supportive of president trump and his
[0.00s - 3.44s]  objectives um now the question is how do they risk the situation and jeff is right
[0.78s - 3.36s]  it's one thing to put a 90-day stop on these other companies
[0.00s - 3.42s]  where does the bulk of supply come from for manufacturers and retailers?
[0.00s - 3.44s]  are like china their shops on the city right now those boats have got
[0.00s - 2.46s]  a lot of product in there, what are we going to do?
[0.00s - 3.04s]  5% tariff on those, come on, it's not feasible
[0.00s - 2.54s]  and i really see the problems, i really see the pain on the amazon web pages
[0.00s - 3.36s]  uh we have multiple problems the first is trying to turn this
[0.00s - 3.40s]  straight into a strategy the second is dealing with this problem with china right now
[0.24s - 3.34s]  china's got a very strong hand in this conversation, very strong hand
[0.00s - 2.78s]  and, you know, had we started the other way around,
[2.84s - 3.44s]  had we started negotiating
[0.00s - 3.60s]  with 75 countries and not put the screws on china to the
[0.00s - 3.20s]  extent that we have, we may be in a different position or not so the question is how to deal with it
[0.00s - 3.52s]  and jeff is right those people who really depend upon these components from china for their retail
[0.00s - 3.54s]  sales, for their manufacturing, for their supply chain
[0.00s - 3.42s]  in general, they're going to have to scramble, and they're going to be in a
[0.00s - 3.18s]  world is good this is going to reset china, america
[0.00s - 3.40s]  relationships for the next century, half a century, much like nixon did
[0.00s - 2.64s]  in 1972 this is going to be the same sort of moment
[0.00s - 3.26s]  and it really sets china up as the, you know,
[0.00s - 3.44s]  russia of the 60s and 70s
[0.00s - 3.30s]  so we've got a lot of work to do
[0.75s - 2.99s]  i'm going to add kutrop and gisa down
[0.00s - 3.42s]  and luck shaking hands, they both have the propensity
[0.00s - 3.20s]  need to be able to pull it off i don't know that they will so i'm not i'm not
